# NLP-CaseStudies
This repository contains data and code to analyze multiple case studies via natural language processing approach. 
They are mainly related to topics of nuclear engineering, energy but also related to possible nuclear war opinion, nuclear issues, social acceptance of nuclear and maybe in the future something about seismology not already explored. 
# Nuclear Social acceptance
This is part of the project developed at my internship in the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non Proliferation VCDNP.
